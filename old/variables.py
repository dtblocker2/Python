#yup python also support variables you can make custom variable by
name = "kaku"
age = 18
price = 1.99

#now print these things
print(name)
#caution: don't use ""
print("name")

print("my age is", age)

#shifting of variable values
age_2 = age
print(age_2)

#method to get to know type of data entered in variable/identifiers
print(type(name)) #this is str (string)
print(type(age)) #this is int (integer)
print(type(price)) #this is float
